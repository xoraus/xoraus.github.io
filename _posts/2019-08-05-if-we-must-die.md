If we must die, let it not be like hogs\
Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,\
While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,\
Making their mock at our accursèd lot.

If we must die, O let us nobly die,\
So that our precious blood may not be shed\
In vain; then even the monsters we defy\
Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!

O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe!\
Though far outnumbered let us show us brave,\
And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!\
What though before us lies the open grave?

Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack,\
Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!

This stanza-by-stanza explanation will provide an interpretation of the poem "If We Must Die" by Claude McKay:

**Stanza 1:**
"If we must die, let it not be like hogs\
Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,\
While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,\
Making their mock at our accursèd lot."

In this stanza, the speaker opens by acknowledging the possibility of death. They use a powerful metaphor to describe the indignity and brutality of dying like "hogs," hunted and trapped in a dishonorable and confined place. The "mad and hungry dogs" represent the merciless and mocking adversaries who are causing suffering. The speaker conveys a sense of defiance against this dehumanizing fate.

**Stanza 2:**
"If we must die, O let us nobly die,\
So that our precious blood may not be shed\
In vain; then even the monsters we defy\
Shall be constrained to honor us though dead!"

The second stanza continues the theme of facing death with dignity and valor. The speaker implores that if they are to die, it should be a noble death, one that is not in vain. They believe that if they confront their adversaries courageously, even the "monsters" who oppose them will have no choice but to respect and honor their memory.

**Stanza 3:**
"O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe!\
Though far outnumbered let us show us brave,\
And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow!\
What though before us lies the open grave?"

In this stanza, the speaker addresses their fellow "kinsmen" or comrades, emphasizing the need to confront the shared enemy. Despite being outnumbered, they advocate for bravery and unity. The idea is to fight back strongly and effectively, even if it means delivering a decisive blow in the face of numerous attacks. The mention of the "open grave" reminds the reader of the potential consequences of their resistance.

**Stanza 4:**
"Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack,\
Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!"\

The final stanza serves as a rallying cry. The speaker asserts that they will face the "murderous, cowardly pack" of adversaries bravely, even when cornered and facing death. They are determined to fight back, highlighting their unwavering resolve to resist oppression and injustice.

Overall, Claude McKay's poem "If We Must Die" is a powerful call to courage and resistance in the face of adversity. It speaks to the idea of facing death with honor and dignity, even when outnumbered or oppressed, and it encourages unity and defiance in the pursuit of justice.
